You can insert, remove, select and drag the notes, if you hold shift you can copy the selection. When a note or multiple notes are selected, you can drag them to make the note velocity longer or shorter. There is support for Ghost notes, you can set the player loop on the top. I made this for a Midi Editor i worked on.
I made it to look like FL Studio's pianoroll editor, but you can change all the colors in the property editor to give it your own style/look and feel.
